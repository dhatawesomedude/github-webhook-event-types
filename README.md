# github-webhook-event-types

List of Github Webhook intefaces from: https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/

Into TypeScript type interfaces, so you can use them anywhere.

## Difference between this and orta's original

Orta's original is a script to generate types.

This is a snapshot of the generated types manually refactored to follow the same structure, but to reuse certain common Interfaces.

### Why?

I wanted to use a service to handle Issues from different Webhook's and Orta's generated types did not give a common parent that I could use.
